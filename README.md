# HYDROGEN 
  Hydrogen is a Compiler that compiles a subset of C to Risc-v.

## GOALS 
  Build make a basic compiler and add optimzations.
  Evaluate performance using Gem5 by:
    Cache Misses
    Wasted Cycles
    Execution Metrics

## FEATURES 
  Tokenizer
  Parser
  Code Generator
  optional optimizations

## WORKFLOW 
  Write test code in C
  Compile with Hydrogen and generate .s files
  run simulations with rars and optionally GEM5

## WHY? 
  I was bored
